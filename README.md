# etch-a-sketch

Build a simple version of a etch a sketch pad where you can hover your mouse over a div to draw/leave a trail.

The main purpose of this project is to learn how to use flex box and create it base on the user's input along with setting up hover event listener and update the page dynamically base on the user's hover action.
